2. **Access Your Services:**
   - **Frontend**: http://localhost:80
   - **API**: http://localhost:4080
   - **Prisma Studio**: http://localhost:5555
   - **PostgreSQL**: localhost:5432

### **Prisma Studio Features:**

- **CRUD Operations**: Add, edit, delete users through the GUI
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes reflect immediately
- **Query Interface**: Run custom queries visually
- **Relationship Visualization**: See how your models connect

### **Your Architecture Flow:**
```
Frontend (React/Next.js) 
    â†“ HTTP Requests
API (Next.js API Routes)
    â†“ Prisma ORM
PostgreSQL Database
    â†“ Prisma Studio (Visual Interface)
```

## **Overall Assessment: Excellent Setup! ðŸŒŸ**

Your architecture is **very solid**:
- âœ… Modern tech stack
- âœ… Proper containerization
- âœ… Database abstraction with Prisma
- âœ… RESTful API design
- âœ… Development-friendly with hot reloading

The only thing missing was Prisma Studio, which I've now added. This gives you a complete development environment where you can:
- Develop your frontend
- Test your API endpoints
- Manage your database visually
- Debug data relationships

Would you like me to help you test this setup or explain any other aspects of your architecture?
